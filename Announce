Here is the announcement for MsqlPerl 1.00 and 1.01 in one go. (As
1.01 is just a trivial patch)

a new interface
    more intuitive, less to type, will most probably allow an
    emulation of MsqlPerl with an underlying DBD::Msql (expect an
    announcement for DBD::mSQL by Alligator Descates RSN). The main
    point of the interface is, that it hides the object attributes
    behind methods.

a memory leak less
    Thanks to Dan McGuirk <mcguirk@indirect.com>!

(nearly) full backwards compatibility
    1.00 will most probably be the last version that supports the
    old-style interface with direct access to the object
    attributes. Unless you speak up, of course, I will change the
    underlying code and thusly the object structure in future
    releases.

Insert() method is gone
    In the beginning it caused a lot of confusion. Then I realized
    that most people used it blindly although it was warned against it
    as VERY inefficient. Finally I realized that the jump from alpha
    into a release is the last chance to throw it away -- and did so.

support for NULL fields
    Thanks to Dirk.vanGulik <Dirk.vanGulik@jrc.it>

The variable $Msql::QUIET
    disables error messages from the msql daemon if the -w switch is on.

Get it from

    ftp://franz.ww.tu-berlin.de/pub/perl/MsqlPerl-1.01.tar.gz
or  ftp://bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql/Contrib/MsqlPerl-1.01.tar.gz

If you find old releases of MsqlPerl on any server, please let the
administrator and/or me know! There are too many a1 versions still
around, which are practically useless today.
