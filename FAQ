Subject: HPUX compilation goes wrong...

    From: Yiorgos Adamopoulos <Y.Adamopoulos@noc.ntua.gr>

    I successfully compiled MsqlPerl for a HP817 (HP-UX 9.04/s800) using Perl5.002,
    msql-1.0.14 and gcc-2.7.2.  I added CC_ONLY = -fPIC to site.mm after running
    setup.


Subject: Where can I find more documentation?

    Msql.pm IS the manpage in pod format. If you're on UNIX you should be
    able to read it with 'man Msql'. On other operation systems try
    'perldoc Msql'. Also, the test script, t/msql.t might help you to sort
    things out. The most recent addition is the pmsql program which may
    also help you to learning by example.
