    perl comes with a program pod2man and another one called
    pod2html. Both reside in the pod/ subdirectory of the perl source
    tree. The current version of perl (5.001L) installs both programs
    by default.

	Msql.pm IS the manpage in pod format. Get perl5.001m or better
	and after 'make install' you can try 'perldoc Msql' and read
	the manpage. Also, the test script, t/msql.t might help you to
	sort things out.
